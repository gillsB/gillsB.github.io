	<h2><p>Game Engine:</p></h2>
	<p> Starting last semester in csc 165, I started building my own game engine with the <strong>RAGE</strong> (<strong>R</strong>aymonds <strong>A</strong>wesome <strong>G</strong>ame <strong>E</strong>ngine) 
        as a framework. The base RAGE version we recived had only the very basic necessities for creating a game engine. 
        Everything from movement, rotations, lighting, effects, networking, and many other basic properties of an engine had to be implemented from scratch.
    </p>
    <h2><p>RoboFight:</p></h2>
    <p>RoboFight was a game that I created as my proof of concept and implementation for my game engine. Although it appears like a simple and old style game, because the game engine,
        all external models, networking, and gameplay mechanics were designed from scratch it was a very complex and very hard game to create. It is based on a boss fight where you fight the large robot.
        The robot's actions change based on both timing and where the players are in the room. For instance he will randomly summon black holes which will spin around the room and kill the player if they get
        too close. There is a small walkway on the side of the room which will allow the player to hit a button which will do a large chunk of damage to the boss 1 time, however if the boss notices the player near 
        that walkway it will create a wind mechanic which will continuously move the player thus making it very hard to walk down the walkway without falling off. Another mechanic is the predictive slams. 
        Predictive slams will estimate the players position in the next two seconds and then slam down the robots hand, killing the player if it comes into touch with it. However, using this predictive slam
        the player can cause the hand to slam onto a black hole, thus causing damage to the boss as his hand is ripped into the black hole. All of the mechanics are also implemented with voice acted 3D sound audio 
        cues to allow the player to understand, learn, and predict the boss actions. So although the game might seem basic there is a bit of depth to the gameplay.
